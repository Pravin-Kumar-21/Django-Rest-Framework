while working with the Session and Authentication we have delared the
session and Authentication in the server views.py file but what about the client Files 

We also need to make sure that the client File also find that the session is active and the
user is authenticated or not 

So what do we need to do we need basically to get to the authenticated Endpoint 




for eg:
http://localhost:8000/admin
session then it will check for active session -> post data
selenium that will check for active session 


but this not necessary for vast majority of Api when you want to expose the third party users.
